Welcome to 4s
=============

This is the documentation of ``fours``, a Python package for PSF subtraction
with the 4S method for exoplanet high contrast imaging (HCI) datasets. In this
documentation, we explain the how to use the package and provide some guides to
help you `get started <01_getting_started.rst>`_. We also provide the code to
`reproduce the plots <04_apples_with_apples/01_general.rst>`_ in our paper.

We did our best to follow best practices for software development and
document all important steps. However, the code is **still experimental**.
**Additional documentation on the code will be added in the future after
publication of the paper.**

Please read the section about `Citation <05_citation.rst>`_ if you use fours.
